                Personally, I consider Windows the least secure mainstream operating system. Microsoft has acknowledged that more than 30% of Windows 11’s code now ships via AI-assisted generation. That is a lot of opaque logic running on your machine. The platform increasingly behaves like spyware masquerading as an OS.

            <ul class="terminal-alert-content">
                <li>Windows 11 “Copilot” is being wired into the shell, clipboard, and browser to collect your activity so it can “assist.” Opting out is difficult and updates re-enable it for many users.</li>
                <li>Fresh installs now force a Microsoft account just to sign in locally, funneling telemetry and your device metadata straight to Microsoft’s cloud. Breaking that dependency requires registry hacks or enterprise policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="terminal-alert-content">
                I highly suggest that you will do your own research about the risks of Windows 11 and Copilot and learn for yourself the dangers of using Windows.

        <h2>1. Lock Down Your Accounts</h2>
        <p>
            Remember when the LinkedIn breach dropped 164 million passwords in 2012? Or when Equifax exposed 147 million Social Security numbers in 2017 because of a single missing patch? Those leaks still fuel credential stuffing attacks today. The only reliable defense is to make every password unique and completely random so one breach cannot domino through the rest of your life. A password manager remembers the boring stuff so you can focus on using one master passphrase and safeguarding it. Pair that with multi-factor authentication (MFA) so even a leaked password is worthless without the second factor. Finally, make sure account recovery emails and phone numbers are up to date and private; if an attacker resets your account, nothing else matters.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Credential stuffing uses automated tools to test billions of leaked username/password combinations across thousands of websites. If you reuse "MyDog2019!" across Gmail, Amazon, and your bank, one breach exposes all three. Password managers generate cryptographically random passwords (128+ bits of entropy) that are impossible to guess. MFA adds a second factor: something you have (phone, hardware key) in addition to something you know (password). Even if attackers steal your password via phishing or keylogger, they can't access your account without the second factor.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Security Impact:</strong> The 2020 Twitter hack succeeded because attackers bypassed weak password policies and targeted employees without hardware-based MFA. SMS-based MFA is vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks where attackers convince your phone carrier to transfer your number to their SIM card. Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) apps like Aegis or FreeOTP generate codes locally, eliminating the SIM swap risk. Hardware security keys (FIDO2/U2F) provide the strongest protection: they're phishing-resistant because the key verifies the website's domain before responding.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong></p>
        <pre data-lang="bash"><code class="language-bash"># Check if your email appeared in known breaches
# Visit: https://haveibeenpwned.com/
# This service aggregates breach databases (LinkedIn, Adobe, Yahoo, etc.)
# Shows which breaches exposed your email and what data was compromised
#
# Or use API (requires free API key from haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key):
curl "https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breachedaccount/your@email.com" \
  -H "hibp-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
# Output shows breach name, date, and compromised data types (passwords, emails, SSNs)
# If found: change passwords immediately on affected sites

# Install KeePassXC (Linux)
# KeePassXC = cross-platform, open-source password manager
# Stores passwords in encrypted database file (.kdbx)
# Uses AES-256 encryption with master password
sudo apt install keepassxc

# Create encrypted password database
# Creates new .kdbx file protected by master password
# Master password = only password you need to remember
# Use strong passphrase: 5+ random words or 20+ character mix
# Example: "correct-horse-battery-staple-mountain"
keepassxc-cli db-create ~/Passwords/master.kdbx
# Prompts for master password (memorize this!)
# Store backup of .kdbx file on USB drive or encrypted cloud

# Generate strong password (32 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
# -L 32 = length 32 characters
# -l = include lowercase (a-z)
# -u = include uppercase (A-Z)
# -n = include numbers (0-9)
# -s = include symbols (!@#$%^&*)
# Generates cryptographically random password
# Output example: "xK9$mP2nQ#vL8wR@tY4jF6hN1sA5cD7g"
keepassxc-cli generate -L 32 -l -u -n -s

# Add entry for website
# Stores login credentials for GitHub in your database
keepassxc-cli add ~/Passwords/master.kdbx GitHub \
  --username your_username \
  --url https://github.com \
  --generate --length 32
# Prompts for master password to unlock database
# --generate creates random password automatically
# --length 32 makes 32-character password for this entry
# Each site gets unique password (breach on one site doesn't affect others)

# Enable TOTP in KeePassXC for 2FA codes
# TOTP = Time-based One-Time Password (6-digit codes that change every 30 seconds)
# Stores 2FA codes in same database as passwords (one-stop security vault)
# Setup:
# 1. Open KeePassXC GUI
# 2. Settings > Security > Enable KeePassXC-Browser integration
# 3. Right-click any entry > TOTP > Set up TOTP
# 4. Scan QR code from website's 2FA setup page
# 5. KeePassXC now generates 2FA codes alongside passwords
# Benefit: No need for separate authenticator app on phone

# Bitwarden CLI for cloud sync
# Bitwarden = cloud-based password manager (encrypted vault stored on Bitwarden servers)
# Zero-knowledge encryption: Bitwarden never sees your master password or decrypted data
# CLI useful for scripting, server management, automation
# Requires Node.js and npm (JavaScript package manager)
npm install -g @bitwarden/cli
# -g installs globally (available system-wide)

# Login to Bitwarden account
bw login
# Prompts for email and master password
# Returns session key (use BW_SESSION env variable for subsequent commands)
# Example: export BW_SESSION="sessionkey"

# Sync local vault with cloud
bw sync
# Downloads latest vault data from Bitwarden servers
# Run after making changes on phone/browser to get updates
# Ensures you have latest passwords across all devices

# Generate strong random password
bw generate --length 32 --uppercase --lowercase --number --special
# Creates 32-character password with all character types
# Output example: "T8#kL3@pN9$wM5%xR2&qC7!vB4^jF6"
# Copy output and paste when creating new account

# gopass for command-line GPG-based password store
# gopass = terminal-friendly password manager using GPG encryption
# Stores each password as separate GPG-encrypted file
# Git integration: sync passwords across machines via Git repo
# Perfect for DevOps, sysadmins, terminal enthusiasts
#
# Install
sudo apt install gopass

# Initialize password store
# Links passwords to your GPG key (must have GPG key first)
# If no GPG key: gpg --full-generate-key
gopass init your@email.com
# Creates ~/.password-store/ directory
# your@email.com = GPG key ID (creates encrypted files only you can decrypt)

# Add password for website
# Prompts to enter password (type or paste)
# Stores as encrypted file: ~/.password-store/websites/github.com/username.gpg
gopass insert websites/github.com/username
# Hierarchical structure: organize by websites/apps/servers
# Example paths:
#   websites/github.com/username
#   servers/production/root
#   databases/mysql/admin

# Retrieve password
# Decrypts and displays password (prompts for GPG passphrase)
gopass show websites/github.com/username
# Copies to clipboard automatically (clears after 45 seconds)
# Use -c flag to copy without displaying: gopass -c websites/github.com/username
# Use in scripts: PASSWORD=$(gopass show -o websites/github.com/username)</code></pre>

        <h2>2. Spot Phishing Before It Hooks You</h2>
        <p>
            Phishing emails and messages try to trick you into clicking malicious links or typing passwords into fake websites. We have seen devastating examples: in 2014 a single spear-phish let attackers into Sony Pictures; in 2020, Twitter employees were duped via phone and internal Slack messages, leading to high-profile account takeovers. The pattern is the same: create panic, urgency, or curiosity so you click first and think later. Whenever possible, open a new tab and type the site address yourself instead of following whatever link they hand you.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Phishing is the #1 initial attack vector. According to Verizon's 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report, 36% of breaches involved phishing. Modern phishing uses legitimate-looking domains (paypаl.com with a Cyrillic 'а'), cloned websites pixel-perfect copies of real login pages, and even compromised legitimate email accounts to send "internal" phishing. Once you enter credentials on a fake site, attackers have immediate access to your real account.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Security Impact:</strong> Spear-phishing targets specific individuals with personalized content (your name, job title, recent activity). Attackers research victims on LinkedIn, Facebook, and corporate websites. Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams impersonate executives requesting wire transfers—FBI reports $43 billion in losses from 2016-2021. Even security-aware individuals fall for sophisticated phishing that exploits trust (messages from compromised colleague accounts) or authority (fake legal notices).</p>

        <h2>3. Stay Patched</h2>
        <p>
            Updates fix known vulnerabilities. Attackers scan the internet for outdated software because it is easier than inventing new tricks. Enable automatic updates for your operating system, browsers, and apps, and restart at least weekly so patches actually install.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> The 2017 WannaCry ransomware exploited EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144), a Windows vulnerability patched two months earlier. Organizations that delayed patching lost an estimated $4 billion. Automated exploit scanners like Shodan and Masscan constantly probe the internet for unpatched systems. Zero-day exploits are rare and expensive; attackers prefer known vulnerabilities because millions of systems remain unpatched.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Security Impact:</strong> Unpatched software provides reliable entry points. The 2017 Equifax breach exploited Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638), patched two months before the attack. Critical vulnerabilities often have public exploit code within days of disclosure. Automatic updates close the window of exposure from months to hours. Weekly restarts ensure pending updates fully apply and clear malware from memory.</p>

        <h2>4. Browse with Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Your browser is the front door to the internet. Stick with maintained browsers, limit extensions, and block trackers that follow you from site to site. Separate profiles for work, personal, and risky browsing keep cookies and logins compartmentalized.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Guard Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
            Oversharing gives attackers the answers to security questions. When forms request information, question whether they truly need it. For throwaway signups, use email aliasing tools to protect your real inbox.
        </p>
        <div class="terminal-warning not-prose">

                <li>Use truthful-but-unpublished answers for security questions (“What is your first car?” can be a random phrase stored in your password manager).</li>
                <li>Lock down social media privacy settings; limit what strangers can see by default.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>6. Secure the Devices in Your Hands</h2>
        <p>
            Phones and laptops carry photos, chats, and saved logins. Protect them with strong unlock methods, encryption, and the ability to wipe them remotely if lost.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-400">
            <li>Enable device encryption: BitLocker (Windows Pro), FileVault (macOS), LUKS/dm-crypt (Linux), and built-in encryption on iOS/Android.</li>
            <li>Turn on “Find My Device” (Apple, Google, Microsoft) and practice triggering a remote lock from another device.</li>
            <li>Configure automatic screen locks after a short period of inactivity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Secure Cloud Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Sync services keep files accessible but cloud providers can technically access unencrypted data. Add your own encryption layer so only you control the keys.
        </p>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>8. Public Wi-Fi Survival</h2>
        <p>
            Open hotspots are convenient but easy to spoof. Avoid accessing sensitive accounts on public Wi-Fi. If you must connect, use your phone as a hotspot or route traffic through a trusted VPN provider with independent audits.</p>

                <li>If you only need occasional secure access, tether to your mobile data instead of public Wi-Fi.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>9. Spot Scams Quickly</h2>
        <p>
            Scammers prefer pressure tactics: rushed deadlines, threats, or promises of big prizes. They might pretend to be tech support or government agents. Slow down, verify independently, and never pay with gift cards or crypto on demand.
        </p>

                <li>Hang up on unsolicited callers and call back using official numbers from the company’s website.</li>
                <li>Never install remote-control software unless you initiated the support session with a trusted company.</li>
                <li>Teach family members to question urgent money requests sent via email, text, or social media.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>10. Mobile Privacy Hygiene</h2>
        <p>
            Smartphones know where you go, who you talk to, and what you photograph. Audit permissions regularly so apps access only what they truly need.
        </p>
        <div class="terminal-info not-prose">

        <h2>11. Backups Save the Day</h2>
        <p>
            Ransomware, theft, and hardware failure all end the same way without backups: lost memories and expensive downtime. Automate backups so they happen even when you forget.
        </p>
        <div class="terminal-success not-prose">

        </div>

        <h2>12. Keep Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Security isn’t a one-time project. Schedule a quarterly “digital tune-up”: review passwords, remove old apps, check device settings, and update your recovery contacts. Stay sharp with approachable sources like <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Krebs on Security</a>, <a href="https://safestack.io/blog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SafeStack blog</a>, or <a href="https://www.schneier.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Schneier on Security</a>.

        <p>
            Build one new habit each week and share what you learn with friends and family. The goal isn't perfection; it's forcing attackers to move on to easier targets.
