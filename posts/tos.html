        <p><strong>You are solely responsible for how you use the information provided on this site.</strong> Unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data is illegal in virtually every jurisdiction.</p>

</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 my-6">
    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> While we strive for technical accuracy, errors may exist. Commands may have unintended side effects on your system.</li>
    <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Guides may omit steps, edge cases, or platform-specific considerations.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Following these guides does not guarantee protection against all threats. Security is a process, not a destination.</li>

<h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, AnonShell, its operators, contributors, and affiliates shall not be liable for:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 my-6">

    </div>
    <p class="terminal-warning-content">
        Always test security configurations in isolated environments (virtual machines, lab networks) before deploying to production systems. A single misconfigured firewall rule can lock you out of your server. A single wrong command can render systems unbootable.
    </p>

<h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
<p>
    While using AnonShell, you agree to:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 my-6">
    <li><strong>Respect the law:</strong> Use information for legal purposes only. "I learned it on AnonShell" is not a legal defense.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect others:</strong> If sharing AnonShell content elsewhere, provide attribution and context.</li>
    <li><strong>Test responsibly:</strong> Only conduct security testing on systems you own or have explicit written authorization to test.</li>
    <li><strong>Report errors responsibly:</strong> If you find inaccuracies or dangerous advice, report it so we can correct it.</li>

    </div>
    <div class="terminal-alert-content space-y-3">
        <p><strong>Free knowledge should remain free.</strong> This content took significant time and expertise to create, and it's provided at zero cost so anyone can learn operational security regardless of their financial situation.</p>
        <p>If you take this free educational content and repackage it into a paid course, ebook, or "premium training program," you're not an entrepreneur—you're exploiting the knowledge commons. You're putting a paywall between people and information that was intentionally made accessible to everyone.</p>
        <p>The NonCommercial clause exists because we've seen too many "cyber security gurus" scrape free resources, add a fancy PDF template, and sell it for $497 as their "exclusive methodology." That's not value creation. That's parasitism.</p>
        <p><strong>If you want to make money in cybersecurity, build something original. Provide consulting. Create tools. But don't commodify knowledge that was shared freely.</strong> Don't be that guy.</p>

    <li>Accept liability for content hosted elsewhere</li>
    <li>Warrant that external links will remain functional</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Audit external tools before running them on your systems.</strong> A malicious script disguised as a security tool can compromise everything you're trying to protect.
</p>

<h2>8. Privacy & Data Collection</h2>
<p>
    As detailed in our <a href="#/posts/privacy.html" class="text-shell-accent hover:underline">Privacy Policy</a>, AnonShell collects <strong>zero visitor data</strong>. No logs, no cookies, no tracking. You can read these terms anonymously without creating an account or providing any information.

    <li>Security recommendations may change as new attack techniques emerge</li>

</p>

<h2>10. Age Restrictions</h2>
<p>
    AnonShell is intended for users who are <strong>mature enough to understand the legal repercussions of their actions.</strong> Some content discusses advanced security concepts that, if misused, could result in criminal prosecution, civil liability, or permanent damage to systems and reputations. If you lack the judgment to distinguish between authorized security testing and illegal unauthorized access, you should only use this site under the supervision of a parent, guardian, or qualified instructor who can provide that context.
</p>

<h2>11. Prohibited Uses</h2>
<p>
    You may not use AnonShell to:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 my-6">
    <li>Plan, coordinate, or execute illegal activities</li>

</p>

<ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 my-6">
    <li><strong>Good-faith negotiation:</strong> We prefer resolving issues directly before involving lawyers.</li>
    <li><strong>Arbitration:</strong> If negotiation fails, disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration rather than litigation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>14. Severability</h2>
<p>
    If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the remaining terms remain in full force and effect.
</p>

    AnonShell reserves the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting to this page. Continued use of the site after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified terms.

    </div>
    <p class="terminal-info-content">
        Legal terms often obscure meaning behind dense legalese. We've written these terms in plain language because operational security requires clear communication. If something isn't clear, the fault is ours, not yours for "not understanding legal language."
